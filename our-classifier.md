1.  What image classifier technology you used for your projects?

  We are currently using the idealo image quality assessment neural network to do our image rating. We first found this repository from one the the weblinks that Professor Goggins provided at the begining of the semester to a medium.com article that described how they used this system to rate hotel images. This system is built using a convolutional neural network.

2.  Whether or not you have started to build classifiers off of the pictures from Ed McCain or if you are still using the default example classifiers. Explain the advantages and limitations of your choice.
